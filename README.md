# Hello!
I've currated this set of information because I thought it would be useful for beginners, initially exploring Linux and open source technologies -- particularly with an eye toward webhosting support.

As with any guide, I cannot possibly predict ALL challenges that may arise, but I've done my best to remove as many bariers to entry as possible, making the lessons as simple and cheap as possible.

The target audience for these materials is someone with a moderate background in computers.  You don't need to know much to get started.  Lord knows I didn't.  But by compiling all of the information I found useful in one place I hope to spare any beginners who come after me from the trouble of hunting down this information.

That being said, the struggle is useful and valuable.  I encourage you to seek out other documentation.  Finding reliable information about software that you are unfamiliar with is, perhaps, the most important skill when working with open source software.

These lessons are broken down by topic, but do not necessarily depend on one another.  If you already have a virtual private server, then you may not need to follow the steps to setting up a practice environment.
